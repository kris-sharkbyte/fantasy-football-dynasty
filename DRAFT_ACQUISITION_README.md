# Dynasty Fantasy Football - Draft & Player Acquisition System

## üéØ Overview

A comprehensive draft and player acquisition system implementing a **Hybrid Acquisition ‚Üí Negotiation** model. This system separates player acquisition (draft/auction/FA) from contract negotiation, giving teams strategic flexibility while maintaining salary cap integrity.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Two-Phase System

#### Phase A: Acquire "Rights"

- Teams acquire **negotiation rights** to players
- No contracts are created during acquisition
- Multiple acquisition modes supported per league

#### Phase B: Contract Negotiation

- Timed negotiation window (48-72 hours)
- Teams must sign or renounce acquired players
- AI-powered agent negotiations
- Contract type limitations (1-3 years max)

---

## üìã Acquisition Modes

### 1. Snake Draft (Recommended for Speed & Fairness)

**For Rookies:**

- Immediately receive fixed rookie scale contracts (2-3 years)
- No negotiation required - automatic signing

**For Veterans:**

- Gain exclusive negotiation rights only
- Must negotiate contract within time window

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
interface SnakeDraftConfig {
  rounds: number;
  timeLimit: number; // seconds per pick
  autodraftDelay: number; // seconds before autodraft
  rookieAutoContracts: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Auction Draft (High Engagement)

**For Veterans:**

- Winning bid grants exclusive negotiation rights
- Auction price becomes a "cap hold" placeholder
- Must finalize contract or cap space returns

**For Rookies:**

- Optional: auction for draft order, then snake draft
- Or auction for players directly with rookie scale

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
interface AuctionDraftConfig {
  bidIncrement: number;
  bidTimeLimit: number;
  maxBudget: number;
  minimumBid: number;
  capHoldMultiplier: number; // auction price * multiplier = cap hold
}
```

### 3. Open Free Agency Rounds (Live Bidding Room)

**Real-time bidding system:**

- Timed rounds (configurable intervals)
- Simultaneous bidding on multiple players
- Highest bid wins negotiation rights

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
interface FreeAgencyRoundConfig {
  roundDuration: number; // seconds
  maxSimultaneousBids: number;
  bidIncrement: number;
  tieBreaker: 'timestamp' | 'random' | 'priority';
}
```

## ü§ù Contract Negotiation System

### Contract Types (Rails-Based)

#### 1-Year "Prove-It" Deal

- **APY Ceiling:** 90% of estimated 2-year value
- **Guarantees:** 60-80% of total value
- **Strategy:** Lower risk for teams, high security for players

#### 2-Year "Bridge" Deal

- **APY:** Market rate
- **Guarantees:** 40-60% of total value
- **Backloading:** Mild allowed (up to 20% variance)

#### 3-Year "Standard" Deal (Maximum)

- **APY Discount:** 5-10% below shorter deals
- **Guarantees:** 30-50% of total value
- **Dead Cap Risk:** Highest if cut early

### Contract Rails Configuration

```typescript
interface ContractRails {
  maxYears: 3;
  minBase: number; // league minimum
  maxSigningBonusPct: 40; // % of total value
  guaranteeRanges: {
    '1year': { min: 60; max: 80 };
    '2year': { min: 40; max: 60 };
    '3year': { min: 30; max: 50 };
  };
  apyDiscounts: {
    '3year': 0.05; // 5% discount vs shorter deals
  };
}
```

---

## ü§ñ AI Agent Negotiation

### Preference Algorithm

```typescript
interface PlayerNegotiationProfile {
  guaranteeBias: number; // 0-1, how much they prioritize guarantees
  lengthPreference: 1 | 2 | 3; // preferred contract length
  apyWeight: number; // importance of average per year
  teamFactors: {
    contenderBonus: number; // extra value for playoff teams
    loyaltyDiscount: number; // discount for current team
    marketSizePreference: number; // preference for big markets
  };
}
```

### Negotiation Flow

1. **Initial Evaluation:** AI agent evaluates team's offer
2. **Market Analysis:** Compare with estimated market value
3. **Counter Logic:**
   - Increase guarantees first (most common)
   - Adjust contract length if outside preference
   - Small APY bumps with diminishing returns
4. **Decision:** Accept, Counter, or Wait for better offers

## üéÆ User Interface Design

### Draft Room Interface (PrimeNG Components)

#### Core Components:

- **Draft Board:** Real-time player availability grid
- **Team Queue:** Draggable player queue for each team
- **Pick Timer:** Countdown with auto-pick functionality
- **Chat System:** Real-time communication
- **Trade Panel:** In-draft pick/player trading

#### Mobile-First Design:

- Swipe navigation between views
- Collapsible panels for space optimization
- Touch-friendly drag & drop

### Negotiation Room Interface

#### Per-Player Negotiation:

```html
<div class="negotiation-container">
  <player-card [player]="selectedPlayer" />

  <contract-builder [contractRails]="leagueRails" [playerProfile]="playerProfile" (offerChange)="previewCapImpact($event)" />

  <cap-impact-preview [offer]="currentOffer" [teamCapSpace]="teamCapSpace" />

  <ai-response-panel [agentResponse]="agentResponse" [negotiationHistory]="negotiationHistory" />

  <action-buttons>
    <button (click)="submitOffer()">Submit Offer</button>
    <button (click)="issueQualifyingOffer()">Issue QO</button>
    <button (click)="applyFranchiseTag()">Franchise Tag</button>
    <button (click)="renounceRights()">Renounce Rights</button>
  </action-buttons>
</div>
```
