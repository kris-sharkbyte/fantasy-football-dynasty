  - [x] Fantasy points integration for better player evaluation

### üéØ **What We're Working On Now**

### üéØ **What We're Working On Now**

The **Player Estimation System** is the core intelligence that determines what contracts players are willing to accept. This system combines:

1. **Enhanced Player Minimum Calculator** - Dynamic contract floors based on market conditions
2. **Market Context Analysis** - League health, cap space, recent signings
3. **Positional Demand** - Supply/demand economics for each position
4. **Player Tier Analysis** - Elite/starter/depth classifications with market values

### üîç **Current Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: Estimated Minimum Shows "N/A"**

- **Problem**: Player minimum calculations returning `NaN` values
- **Root Cause**: Context loading failure in `EnhancedPlayerMinimumService`
- **Solution**: Fixed async context loading and player data conversion

#### **Issue 2: Duplicate Bid Submissions**

- **Problem**: Multiple console logs and temporary duplicate UI entries
- **Root Cause**: Rapid clicking and immediate local state updates
- **Solution**: Added loading state management and removed duplicate state updates

#### **Issue 3: Context Loading Failures**

- **Problem**: `LeagueCapContext` and `MarketRippleContext` not loading
- **Root Cause**: Async constructor calls that never execute
- **Solution**: Implemented `ensureContextsLoaded()` pattern with lazy initialization

| **Minimum Calculation** | üîÑ **Testing** | < 100ms |

### **Optimization Targets**

- [ ] **Context Caching** - Cache market contexts for 5 minutes
- [ ] **Lazy Loading** - Load player data only when needed
- [ ] **Batch Updates** - Group Firestore operations
- [ ] **Memory Management** - Clean up unused listeners

---

## üö® **Known Issues & Workarounds**

### **Issue: Domain Library Integration**

- **Problem**: Firebase Functions can't directly use Nx libraries
- **Workaround**: Manual copy of `libs/domain` and `libs/types` to `apps/functions/src/lib/`
- **Long-term**: Implement build process for automatic library copying

### **Issue: Context Loading Timing**

- **Problem**: Market contexts may not be immediately available
- **Workaround**: Implement fallback to simple calculations
- **Long-term**: Pre-load contexts on app initialization

### **Issue: Player Data Conversion**

- **Problem**: SleeperPlayer vs FAWeekPlayer interface mismatch
- **Workaround**: Convert data in service layer
- **Long-term**: Standardize player interfaces across the system
