Salary Floor (Minimum Ask) — by Tier × Age × Position

Formula baked in: Floor% = TierBase × AgeMod × PosMod
(You don’t need to compute it—tables below are already multiplied.)

Modifiers (for reference)

Tier base: Elite 20%, Starter 10%, Depth 3%

Age: <24 = 0.8, 24–29 = 1.0, 30–33 = 0.7, 34+ = 0.5

Position: QB 1.0, RB/WR 0.8, TE 0.6, OL/DL/EDGE/LB 0.5, CB/S 0.4, K/P 0.2

Rookie Scale (drafted/UDFA)

Use these as floors independent of age buckets (rookies’ leverage is their draft slot). These can replace the Tier × Age floor in Year 1 if you prefer a “rookie wage scale.”

Draft Slot Floor (as % of cap)
Round 1 (Picks 1–8) 8.0%
Round 1 (Picks 9–16) 7.0%
Round 1 (Picks 17–32) 6.0%
Round 2 4.0%
Round 3 3.0%
Round 4 2.5%
Round 5 2.0%
Round 6 1.5%
Round 7 1.0%
UDFA 0.5%

Tip: If you want position to matter for rookies, multiply by the Position Modifiers; otherwise keep them flat for simplicity.

Practical Guards (recommended)

League minimums: Veteran min = 0.3% of cap; Rookie min = 0.2% of cap.

Hard floors only: These are minimums—GMs can offer more.

One-year vets (30+): You can optionally reduce the years requirement while keeping the salary floor.

In-season signings: Pro-rate % by remaining weeks.

Quick “money” example

If your cap is $200,000,000:

25-yo Elite WR (16.0%): $32.0M/yr

31-yo Starter QB (7.0%): $14.0M/yr

22-yo Depth RB (1.9%): $3.8M/yr

Round 3 rookie (3.0%): $6.0M/yr (or apply position mods if you want)
